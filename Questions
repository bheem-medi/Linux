1. What is Linux?
A: Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel. It is the core component of many distributions (distros) like Ubuntu, CentOS, and Fedora.

2. What is the difference between Linux and Unix?
Answer:
Unix: Proprietary OS (e.g., Solaris, AIX)
Linux: Open-source Unix clone
Linux runs on more hardware and is widely used in cloud and servers.

3. What is the Linux file system hierarchy?
Answer:
bash
Copy
Edit
/      - Root directory  
/bin   - Essential binaries  
/boot  - Boot loader files  
/etc   - Configuration files  
/home  - User home directories  
/var   - Variable data (logs, mail)  
/usr   - User applications  
/tmp   - Temporary files


4. What is the difference between su and sudo?
Answer:
su: Switch user (default: root), requires root password.
sudo: Execute command as another user (default: root), requires user's own password and privileges.


7. What is a symbolic link and how is it created?
Answer:
A symbolic link is a reference to another file.

bash
Copy
Edit
ln -s /path/to/original /path/to/link


8. What is the difference between a hard link and a soft link?
Answer:
Hard Link: Points directly to inode. Cannot link directories or across filesystems.
Soft Link: Points to the file path. Can span filesystems, breaks if target is deleted.

9. 12. How do you troubleshoot high CPU usage in Linux?
Answer:
Use top or htop to identify the process.
Use ps -p <pid> -o %cpu,%mem,cmd for details.
Check logs in /var/log.



10. How do you monitor system performance in Linux?
Answer:
top, htop ‚Äì CPU, memory
iostat ‚Äì Disk I/O
vmstat ‚Äì Memory, processes
sar ‚Äì Historical data


11. What is a Kernel in Linux?
Answer:
The kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. It acts as a bridge between the hardware and the software applications.
üîß Functions of the Kernel:
  * Process Management
    Schedules processes, manages multitasking, and handles process creation and termination.
  * Memory Management
    Allocates and manages RAM usage for programs.
  * Device Management
    Controls communication with hardware devices via drivers.
  * File System Management
    Manages data storage, file access, and directory structure.
  * System Calls Interface
    Provides an API for user-space applications to interact with hardware via system calls.

üîç Example Analogy:
Think of the kernel as the manager of a restaurant:
The hardware is the kitchen.
The applications are the waitstaff.
The kernel ensures that orders (data) flow between staff and kitchen smoothly, efficiently, and securely.
üß† Types of Kernels:
Monolithic Kernel (like Linux): All OS services run in kernel space.
Microkernel: Minimal services in kernel; others run in user space.




12. What is LVM and how do you extend a volume?
Answer:
LVM (Logical Volume Manager) allows flexible disk management.
To extend:
bash
Copy
Edit
lvextend -L +10G /dev/vg_name/lv_name
resize2fs /dev/vg_name/lv_name    # For ext4



13. What are inodes?
Answer:
Inodes store metadata about files (size, owner, permissions, timestamps, etc.) but not the filename or contents. Every file has a unique inode.



13. How do you find and delete files older than X days?
Answer:
bash
Copy
Edit
find /path/to/dir -type f -mtime +30 -exec rm -f {} \;



14.  Explain the difference between soft and hard mounts in NFS.
Answer:
Soft mount: Fails quickly if server is unreachable.
Hard mount: Keeps trying until server responds. Safer for critical data but can hang.



15. Explain what nice, renice, and top priority values are.
Answer:
nice: Set priority at start (nice -n 10 script.sh)
renice: Change priority of running process
Priority range: -20 (highest) to 19 (lowest)


16. What is shell?
A: Basically a CMD inteface that lets you interact with OS os called shell. It like a bridge between kernel and me. 



17. What are the basic components of a linux OS?
    * Kernel
    * System Library
    * System Utility
    * Boot loader
    * Applicatiom software









18. What is the init process in linux?
A: 

19. What is RAID?

20. What is systemd?

21. How do you find files in Linuyx?

22. Whas is the difference between softlink and hardlink?

23. How do you change file permission?

24. How do you combine two commands, and what is the use of a pipe (|) in linux?

25. Difference between Bash and DOS 
Ans:  Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) is a command-line interpreter or shell primarily used in Unix-like operating 
systems like Linux and macOS, while DOS (Disk Operating System) was a popular operating system for 
IBM-compatible personal computers in the past. Bash is a powerful scripting language and command
line interface, while DOS is a command-line interface for an older operating system.




26. Where will you check log files in linux? 
Ans: In Linux, log files are typically found within the /var/log directory and its subdirectories. You can explore 
this directory using commands like ls -l /var/log to see the available log files. 




27. What is runlevel in linux ? 
In Linux, a runlevel is a state or mode that defines what services and processes are available on the 
system. Each runlevel represents a specific system configuration and is used to control what gets started 
or stopped when the system boots or changes states.


28. Traditional SysV Init Runlevels (0‚Äì6): 
These are the standard runlevels in most traditional Linux distributions that use the SysV init system: 
Runlevel   Description 
0          Halt (shutdown the system) 
1          Single-user mode (maintenance mode)
2          Multi-user mode without networking 
3          Multi-user mode with networking (text mode) 
4          Undefined / user-definable
5          Multi-user mode with GUI (graphical mode)
6          Reboot the system





29. What is the port number for maven 
Maven itself does not use a specific port number, because it is a build automation tool that runs locally 
(like when you run mvn clean install). It doesn‚Äôt act as a server or listen on a port. 
However, if you're asking about Maven downloading dependencies from a repository (like Maven 
Central), then: 
‚Ä¢ It uses HTTP/HTTPS, which means: 
o Port 80 for HTTP 
o Port 443 for HTTPS (most common for Maven Central) 
If you're using a Maven repository manager like Nexus, Artifactory, or JFrog, then the default ports 
might be: 
‚Ä¢ Nexus Repository Manager: usually runs on port 8081 
‚Ä¢ JFrog Artifactory: default port is often 8081 as well (but can be customized)



30. What is Apache and Tomcat 
Apache is a web server that serves static and dynamic content, while Apache Tomcat is a servlet 
container primarily used for running Java applications. Apache is written in C and is known for its speed 
and efficiency in serving static content like HTML, images, and CSS. Tomcat is written in Java and is 
optimized for serving dynamic content, such as Java Servlets and JSP files.  




31. What is Rsync in Linux 
Rsync is a powerful Linux command-line utility used for transferring and synchronizing files between 
local and remote computers. It's particularly efficient for backing up and restoring data, as it only 
transfers the differences between the source and destination, making it bandwidth-efficient and fast for 
large file transfers. 


32. What is raid in linux 
In Linux, RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a technology that combines multiple physical 
disk drives into a single logical unit to improve performance, data redundancy, or both. It essentially 
creates a virtual storage array that appears as a single device to the operating system.
