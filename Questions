1. What is Linux?
A: Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel. It is the core component of many distributions (distros) like Ubuntu, CentOS, and Fedora.

2. What is the difference between Linux and Unix?
Answer:
Unix: Proprietary OS (e.g., Solaris, AIX)
Linux: Open-source Unix clone
Linux runs on more hardware and is widely used in cloud and servers.

3. What is the Linux file system hierarchy?
Answer:
bash
Copy
Edit
/      - Root directory  
/bin   - Essential binaries  
/boot  - Boot loader files  
/etc   - Configuration files  
/home  - User home directories  
/var   - Variable data (logs, mail)  
/usr   - User applications  
/tmp   - Temporary files


4. What is the difference between su and sudo?
Answer:
su: Switch user (default: root), requires root password.
sudo: Execute command as another user (default: root), requires user's own password and privileges.


7. What is a symbolic link and how is it created?
Answer:
A symbolic link is a reference to another file.

bash
Copy
Edit
ln -s /path/to/original /path/to/link


8. What is the difference between a hard link and a soft link?
Answer:
Hard Link: Points directly to inode. Cannot link directories or across filesystems.
Soft Link: Points to the file path. Can span filesystems, breaks if target is deleted.

9. 12. How do you troubleshoot high CPU usage in Linux?
Answer:
Use top or htop to identify the process.
Use ps -p <pid> -o %cpu,%mem,cmd for details.
Check logs in /var/log.



10. How do you monitor system performance in Linux?
Answer:
top, htop ‚Äì CPU, memory
iostat ‚Äì Disk I/O
vmstat ‚Äì Memory, processes
sar ‚Äì Historical data


11. What is a Kernel in Linux?
Answer:
The kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. It acts as a bridge between the hardware and the software applications.
üîß Functions of the Kernel:
  * Process Management
    Schedules processes, manages multitasking, and handles process creation and termination.
  * Memory Management
    Allocates and manages RAM usage for programs.
  * Device Management
    Controls communication with hardware devices via drivers.
  * File System Management
    Manages data storage, file access, and directory structure.
  * System Calls Interface
    Provides an API for user-space applications to interact with hardware via system calls.

üîç Example Analogy:
Think of the kernel as the manager of a restaurant:
The hardware is the kitchen.
The applications are the waitstaff.
The kernel ensures that orders (data) flow between staff and kitchen smoothly, efficiently, and securely.
üß† Types of Kernels:
Monolithic Kernel (like Linux): All OS services run in kernel space.
Microkernel: Minimal services in kernel; others run in user space.




12. What is LVM and how do you extend a volume?
Answer:
LVM (Logical Volume Manager) allows flexible disk management.
To extend:
bash
Copy
Edit
lvextend -L +10G /dev/vg_name/lv_name
resize2fs /dev/vg_name/lv_name    # For ext4



13. What are inodes?
Answer:
Inodes store metadata about files (size, owner, permissions, timestamps, etc.) but not the filename or contents. Every file has a unique inode.



13. How do you find and delete files older than X days?
Answer:
bash
Copy
Edit
find /path/to/dir -type f -mtime +30 -exec rm -f {} \;



14.  Explain the difference between soft and hard mounts in NFS.
Answer:
Soft mount: Fails quickly if server is unreachable.
Hard mount: Keeps trying until server responds. Safer for critical data but can hang.



15. Explain what nice, renice, and top priority values are.
Answer:
nice: Set priority at start (nice -n 10 script.sh)
renice: Change priority of running process
Priority range: -20 (highest) to 19 (lowest)
