8. What is the use of cut,sed and awk commands?
Ans:  sed(stream editor), awk(Aho Weinberger Kernighan
                              Alfred Aho
                              Peter Weinberger
                              Brian Kernighan (also co-creator of Unix and C)



📌 cut – The Scissors
Real-life Analogy: You're cutting out specific columns from a table or lines from a page.
🔧 Purpose:
Extract specific columns or character positions from a file or input.

Example File: data.txt

John,Doe,28,Engineer
Alice,Smith,34,Doctor
Bob,Brown,22,Student

cut -d',' -f1 data.txt

-d',' – Use comma as the separator.
-f1 – field number Extract first field (column).

output:
John
Alice
Bob


📌 sed – The Editor
Real-life Analogy: You're using Find and Replace in a text editor.
🔧 Purpose:
Stream editor – modify, delete, or replace text on the fly.

eg. sed 's/Engineer/Developer/' data.txt

s → substitute
's/old/new/' → replace first "Engineer" with "Developer" in each line

🧠 Like using Ctrl+H (Find & Replace) in Word.
You can also delete lines, insert, or transform text.


 awk – The Analyst
Real-life Analogy: A data analyst summarizing info from a table.
🔧 Purpose:
Field-based text processing & reporting tool – great for summarizing, filtering, and reformatting.

e.g;  awk -F',' '{print $1 " is a " $4}' data.txt

-F',' – Use comma as field separator, same as delimiter in sed 
{print $1 " is a " $4} – Print first and fourth fields with a sentence.

output: 
John is a Engineer
Alice is a Doctor
Bob is a Student







9. 12. How do you troubleshoot high CPU usage in Linux?
Answer:
Use top or htop to identify the process.
Use ps -p <pid> -o %cpu,%mem,cmd for details.
Check logs in /var/log.



10. How do you monitor system performance in Linux?
Answer:
top, htop – CPU, memory
iostat – Disk I/O
vmstat – Memory, processes

13. What are inodes?
Answer:
Inodes store metadata about files (size, owner, permissions, timestamps, etc.) but not the filename or contents. Every file has a unique inode.



13. How do you find and delete files older than X days?
Answer:
find /path/to/dir -type f -mtime +30 -exec rm -f {} \;



14.  Explain the difference between soft and hard mounts in NFS.
Answer:
Soft mount: Fails quickly if server is unreachable.
Hard mount: Keeps trying until server responds. Safer for critical data but can hang.



15. Explain what nice, renice, and top priority values are.
Answer:
nice: Set priority at start (nice -n 10 script.sh)
renice: Change priority of running process
Priority range: -20 (highest) to 19 (lowest)


16. What is shell?
A: Basically a CMD inteface that lets you interact with OS os called shell. It like a bridge between kernel and me. 



17. What are the basic components of a linux OS?
    * Kernel
    * System Library
    * System Utility
    * Boot loader
    * Applicatiom software


18. What is the init process in linux?
A:  * The init process in Linux is the first process started by the kernel once it finishes loading during the boot process.
    * init is the foundation of process management on a Linux system, setting the stage for all other operations. 
    * It's the system's way of organizing and starting services during boot and ensuring everything runs as expected.
    * It has the process ID (PID) of 1, and it is the parent of all other processes on the system.
    * Key Functions of init:
        System Initialization:
            Sets up the system environment.
            Mounts filesystems.
            Starts essential services (e.g., network, logging).

    * Starting Other Processes:
            Spawns other daemons and services based on its configuration.
            Reads its configuration file to determine what to launch at various runlevels or targets.

    * Managing Runlevels (SysV) or Targets (systemd):
            Decides which set of services/processes to run based on the system's runlevel or target.
            Reaping Zombie Processes:
            As PID 1, init is responsible for adopting and cleaning up orphaned processes.






20. What is systemd?
Ams: systemd is a modern system and service manager for Linux operating systems.
    * It is designed to initialize the system, manage system services, and handle system states once the Linux kernel finishes booting.
    * It has replaced older init systems like SysVinit in most modern Linux distributions.
    systemd is the default init system in most modern Linux distros (like Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS).
    It's powerful, efficient, and offers advanced features for managing services and the overall system state.

Common systemd Commands:
systemctl status nginx
systemctl start sshd	
systemctl enable apache2	


21. What is Booting and booting process?
A:  Booting is the process your computer goes through when you turn it on to load the operating system (Linux, in this case) so you can use it.

🧰 Linux Boot Process — Step-by-Step
Here’s a simplified flow of the Linux boot process:

Power ON ➝ BIOS/UEFI ➝ Bootloader ➝ Kernel ➝ init/systemd ➝ Login


Let’s break that down:

1. ⚙️ BIOS / UEFI (Basic Input/Output System / Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
The computer's firmware runs first.
It checks the hardware (RAM, CPU, keyboard, etc.) — this is called POST (Power-On Self-Test).
Then it looks for a bootable device (like your hard drive or USB).

📝 Example: The BIOS finds your SSD and loads the bootloader from it.

2. 🥾 Bootloader (e.g., GRUB)
The bootloader chooses which OS to load (especially if you have multiple installed).

Loads the Linux kernel into memory.

📝 Example: GRUB menu shows "Ubuntu" and "Advanced Options"; you select Ubuntu.

3. 🐧 Kernel Loads
The Linux kernel takes over.

It sets up memory, devices, and mounts the root filesystem (your hard drive).

Then it starts the init process (like systemd).

📝 Example: You see messages like Loading Linux... or vmlinuz.

4. 🚦 Init System Starts (e.g., systemd)
This is PID 1 — the first real process on the system.

Starts services like:
Network
Login manager
Disk mounting
GUI (if desktop)

📝 Example: systemd starts services like network.service, ssh.service, etc.

5. 🔑 Login Prompt / Desktop
You get a login prompt (if CLI) or the GUI login screen.
You log in and start using the system.

📝 Example: You see the Ubuntu login screen, enter your password, and reach your desktop.

🖼️ Simple Visual

[Power ON]
     ↓
[BIOS/UEFI]
     ↓
[GRUB Bootloader]
     ↓
[Linux Kernel Loads]
     ↓
[systemd (PID 1) starts]
     ↓
[Login Prompt or GUI]
🔁 Example in Action
You press the power button →
BIOS checks your SSD →
GRUB loads and shows Ubuntu →
You select Ubuntu →
The kernel loads Linux →
systemd starts background services →
Login screen appears →
You log in and start using your computer!

✅ Summary
Step	What Happens
BIOS/UEFI	Starts the hardware, looks for bootloader
Bootloader (GRUB)	Loads the Linux kernel
Kernel	Sets up system, mounts root filesystem
Init system (systemd)	Starts services
Login	You log in to use the system







22. How do you find files in Linuyx?

Ans: In Linux, you can use find and locate to search for files—but they work very differently.
    * 🔍 Using find — Like Walking Through Every Shelf
          You go to the library and look at every book on every shelf until you find the one you want.

          Takes longer, but it's always up to date.

            🖥️ On your computer:
                find / -name "file.txt"





    * 📚 Using locate — Like Searching a Catalog
            You use a catalog or database that lists all books as of last night.
            Very fast, but it might not show new books added today.

            🖥️ On your computer:

                   # locate file.txt

                This uses a pre-built list of files. It’s fast, but not always up to date.
When Should You Use Each?
* Use find if:
    You just created a file
    You want exact, up-to-date results
    You want to search by size, date, type, etc.
* Use locate if:
    You need a fast search
    You don’t care if it’s slightly outdated
    You know the file name and just want to find its location quickly




24. How do you combine two commands, and what is the use of a pipe (|) in linux?

################################################################################################################################


25. Difference between Bash and DOS 
Ans:  Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) is a command-line interpreter or shell primarily used in Unix-like operating 
systems like Linux and macOS, while DOS (Disk Operating System) was a popular operating system for 
IBM-compatible personal computers in the past. Bash is a powerful scripting language and command
line interface, while DOS is a command-line interface for an older operating system.




26. Where will you check log files in linux? 
Ans: In Linux, log files are typically found within the /var/log directory and its subdirectories. You can explore 
this directory using commands like ls -l /var/log to see the available log files. 




27. What is runlevel in linux ? 
In Linux, a runlevel is a state or mode that defines what services and processes are available on the 
system. Each runlevel represents a specific system configuration and is used to control what gets started 
or stopped when the system boots or changes states.


28. Traditional SysV Init Runlevels (0–6): 
These are the standard runlevels in most traditional Linux distributions that use the SysV init system: 
Runlevel   Description 
0          Halt (shutdown the system) 
1          Single-user mode (maintenance mode)
2          Multi-user mode without networking 
3          Multi-user mode with networking (text mode) 
4          Undefined / user-definable
5          Multi-user mode with GUI (graphical mode)
6          Reboot the system





29. What is the port number for maven 
Maven itself does not use a specific port number, because it is a build automation tool that runs locally 
(like when you run mvn clean install). It doesn’t act as a server or listen on a port. 
However, if you're asking about Maven downloading dependencies from a repository (like Maven 
Central), then: 
• It uses HTTP/HTTPS, which means: 
o Port 80 for HTTP 
o Port 443 for HTTPS (most common for Maven Central) 
If you're using a Maven repository manager like Nexus, Artifactory, or JFrog, then the default ports 
might be: 
• Nexus Repository Manager: usually runs on port 8081 
• JFrog Artifactory: default port is often 8081 as well (but can be customized)



30. What is Apache and Tomcat 
Apache is a web server that serves static and dynamic content, while Apache Tomcat is a servlet 
container primarily used for running Java applications. Apache is written in C and is known for its speed 
and efficiency in serving static content like HTML, images, and CSS. Tomcat is written in Java and is 
optimized for serving dynamic content, such as Java Servlets and JSP files.  




31. What is Rsync in Linux 
Rsync is a powerful Linux command-line utility used for transferring and synchronizing files between 
local and remote computers. It's particularly efficient for backing up and restoring data, as it only 
transfers the differences between the source and destination, making it bandwidth-efficient and fast for 
large file transfers. 


32. What is raid in linux 
In Linux, RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a technology that combines multiple physical 
disk drives into a single logical unit to improve performance, data redundancy, or both. It essentially 
creates a virtual storage array that appears as a single device to the operating system. 



33. What are Nginx log files in Linux 
NGINX has two types of logs. the error log and the access log. By default, these logs are written 
simultaneously. The access and error logs are usually located at /var/log/nginx on popular Linux 
distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS or Debian. 
In Linux, Nginx log files are files where the Nginx web server records information about its activity. 
These logs are crucial for monitoring, debugging, and analyzing how the server is handling requests.




34. What is Linux, and what are its basic components? 
Linux is a Unix-like, open-source operating system that's widely used across various devices, from 
desktops to servers. Its core components are the kernel, system libraries, and system utilities. The kernel 
manages hardware, system libraries provide functionality, and system utilities perform specific tasks. 

 
 35. What are the different types of file permissions in Linux? 
In Linux, file permissions control who can access and modify files. The core permissions are read, write, 
and execute, represented by 'r', 'w', and 'x' respectively. These permissions are assigned to three 
categories: the owner, the group, and other users.  



36. What is the difference between su and sudo commands in Linux? 
In Linux, su and sudo are both used to execute commands with elevated privileges, but they differ in 
how they manage user switching and password requirements. sudo allows a user to execute specific 
commands as root (or another user) using their own password, while su switches to another user 
entirely, requiring the password of that user. 

su: Switch user (default: root), requires root password.
sudo: Execute command as another user (default: root), requires user's own password and privileges.




37. What is the purpose of the chmod command in Linux? 
The chmod command in Linux is used to change the access permissions of files and directories. It allows 
you to control who can read, write, and execute a specific file or directory, affecting its security and 
accessibility. 



38. How do you check the current working directory in Linux? 
To determine the exact location of the current directory at a shell prompt and type the command pwd.  
This example shows that you are in the user sam’s directory, which is in the /home/ directory. The 
command pwd stands for print working directory. 




39. What is the purpose of the grep command in Linux? 
The grep command in Linux is a powerful text search tool. It's used to find lines that match a specific 
pattern or text within one or more files. Essentially, grep (which stands for "Global Regular Expression 
Print") is used to filter and search for specific text in files, making it indispensable for tasks like log 
analysis, troubleshooting, and data processing.



40. How do you find the process ID of a running process in Linux? 
You can list running processes using the ps command (ps means process status). The ps command 
displays your currently running processes in real-time. This will display the process for the current shell 
with four columns: PID returns the unique process ID



41. What is Kernel? Explain its functions. 
Answer: A kernel is considered the main component of Linux OS. It is simply a resource manager that acts as a 
bridge between hardware and software. Its main role is to manage hardware resources for users and is 
generally used to provide an interface for user-level interaction. A kernel is the first program that is loaded 
whenever a computer system starts. It is also referred to as low-level system software. 
main functions include: 
Memory Management 
Process Management 
Device Management 
Storage Management 
Manage access, and use of various peripherals that are connected to the computer. 

The kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. It acts as a bridge between the hardware and the software applications.
🔧 Functions of the Kernel:
  * Process Management
    Schedules processes, manages multitasking, and handles process creation and termination.
  * Memory Management
    Allocates and manages RAM usage for programs.
  * Device Management
    Controls communication with hardware devices via drivers.
  * File System Management
    Manages data storage, file access, and directory structure.
  * System Calls Interface
    Provides an API for user-space applications to interact with hardware via system calls.

🔍 Example Analogy:
Think of the kernel as the manager of a restaurant:
The hardware is the kitchen.
The applications are the waitstaff.
The kernel ensures that orders (data) flow between staff and kitchen smoothly, efficiently, and securely.
🧠 Types of Kernels:
Monolithic Kernel (like Linux): All OS services run in kernel space.
Microkernel: Minimal services in kernel; others run in user space.


42. What is swap space? 
Swap space, as the name suggests, is basically a space on a hard disk that is used when the amount of 
physical memory or RAM is full. It is considered a substitute for physical memory. Its main function is to 
substitute disk space for RAM memory when real RAM does not have enough space to hold all programs 
that are executing, and more space is required.



43.  What is Linux Shell? What types of Shells are there in Linux? 
Linux shell is a user interface present between user and kernel. It is used for executing commands and 
communication with Linux OS. Linux shell is basically a program used by users for executing commands. 
It accepts human-readable commands as input and converts them into kernel understandable language. 
Different types of shells:  
CSH (C Shell) 
KSH (Korn Shell) 
BASH (Bourne Again Shell) 
TCSH 
ZSH 
Bourne Shell


44. What are file permissions in Linux? Name different types of file systems in Linux. 
There are three owners in the Linux System i.e., user, group, and others. These owners have three types 
of permissions defined as listed below: 
Read (r): It allows the user to open and read the file or list the directory. 
Write (w): It allows the user to open and modify the file. One can also add new files to the directory. 
Execute (x): It allows the user to execute or run the file. One can also lookup a specific file within a 
directory.



45. What is LVM and why is it required? 
LVM (Logical Volume Management) is basically a tool that provides logical volume management for the 
Linux kernel. It is being introduced simply to make physical storage device management easier. It also 
includes allocating disks, striping, mirroring, resizing logical volumes. Its main advantages are increased 
abstraction, flexibility, and control. It simply allows for flexible disk space management. It is especially 
required to resize the size of the file system online. In Linux, the size of the LVM partition can be 
extended using “lvextend” command and can be reduced using “lvreduce” commands, respectively.

LVM (Logical Volume Manager) allows flexible disk management.
To extend:
lvextend -L +10G /dev/vg_name/lv_name
resize2fs /dev/vg_name/lv_name    # For ext4


46.  What is INODE and Process Id? 
INODE: It is a unique name given to each file by OS. Each inode has a unique inode number within a file 
system. It stores various information about files in Linux such as ownership, file size, file type, access 
mode, number of links, etc. 
Process Id (Identifier): It is a unique Id given to each process. It is simply used to uniquely identify an 
active process throughout the system until the process terminates.




47. Name default ports used for DNS, SMTP, FTP, SSH, DHCP and squid. 
Default ports used for various services are as follows: 
Service Port 
DNS     53 
SMTP    25 
FTP     20 (Data transfer), 21 (Connection established) 
SSH     22 
DHCP    67/UDP (dhcp server), 68/UDP (dhcp client) 
squid   3128



48. Write the difference between Soft and Hard links? 
Answer: Hard Links: It is a special kind of file that points to the same underlying inode as another file. It can be 
referred to as an additional name for an existing file on Linux OS. Total number of hard links for a file can 
be displayed using the “ls -l” command. 
Soft Links: It is also termed a symbolic Link. Soft links are kinds of files that usually point to another file. 
It does not include any amount of data in the target file and simply points to another entry anywhere in 
the file system.
Hard Link: Points directly to inode. Cannot link directories or across filesystems.
Soft Link: Points to the file path. Can span filesystems, breaks if target is deleted.



49. What is samba? Why is it required? 
Samba is basically an open-source software suite. It runs a number of different Operating systems such 
as OpenVMS, IBM , etc. It is generally used to connect Linux machines to Microsoft network resources 
simply by providing Microsoft SMB support. 
It provides more secure, stable, fast file and print services for every client or user using SMB (Server 
Message Block) or CIFS (Central Server Message Block) protocol. 




50.  Explain about chmod command? 
Answer: The chmod command is used for changing the permissions of files and directories. There are 
three types of permissions, read, write and execute and are represented by numbers as shown below. 
* 4 - read permission 
* 2 - write permission 
* 1- execute permission



51.  What are the process states in Linux? 
Answer: There are 5 process states in Linux; 
* New / Ready process 
* Running process 
* Blocked or Wait for process 
* Terminated or completed the process 
* Zombie process.




52. What Is A Zombie process? 
Answer : Zombie is a process state when the child dies before the parent process.



53.  How Do You Find Out All Processes That Are Currently Running? 
Answer : ps -f (-f does full-format listing.) 


54. How Do You Kill A Process? 
Answer : kill -9 8 (process_id 8) 



55. What command do you use to All Mounted Drives? 
Answer : mount -l 




56. What Is Meant By Sticky Bit? 
Answer : When the sticky bit is set on a world writable directory, only the owner can delete any file 
contained in that directory. 



57.  What Is Nfs? What Is Its Job? 
Answer : NFS stands for Network File System. NFS enables filesystems physically residing on one 
computer system to be used by other computers in the network, appearing to users on the remote host 
as just another local disk.




58. What Account Is Created When You Install Linux? 
Answer : its root account - Whenever you install Linux, only one user account is created. This is the 
super user account also known as root.




59. What Utility Can You Use To Automate Rotation Of Logs?
